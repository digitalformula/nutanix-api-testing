# Nutanix API Testing

Tiny PHP demo that I use to throw top-level API calls to a cluster.

## Installation

After grabbing the source, you'll need to install PHP Composer from http://getcomposer.org.

Once that's installed, go to the demo app's directory and run the following command.

```composer install```

## Running The Demo

You'll need a web server of some sort e.g. MAMP on OS X or Windows if you don't have an existing one to use.

On OS X you should also be able to run this from within the demo app's directory.

```php -S localhost:8000```

Then just browse to http://localhost:8000 (and hope nothing else is already using port 8000).  :)
